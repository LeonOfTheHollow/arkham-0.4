// It is important to note that what is stored here is the *client-side* information for each card.
// This should be considered a sort of 'key', to be used to access deeper properties of the cards wehen necessary on the server.
// This way, the game state does not need to contain (and more importantly, pass back and forth), the JS describing the effects of each card.
